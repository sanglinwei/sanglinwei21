## Bridge the gap between learning and optimization for energy system

## Introduction 
I'm pursing my Ph.d degree advised by Yinliang Xu in Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, Shenzhen, China, which belong to EMS group head by Hongbin Sun. I'm trying to aim higher and to be a problem solver in energy system by CS and optimization techniques. I have been supporting Bayern Munich FC since 2011. My CV is [here](https://github.com/sanglinwei/CV/blob/master/resume.pdf).

## Researches

- Image-based skills (from OpenCV to CNN-based)
- Multi-armed bandits problem for demand response
- Distributed optimization and control
- Online optimization and learning works
- Renewables / electricity prices predictions
- Learning-based optimization
- Optimization-based learning
- Low carbon economics
