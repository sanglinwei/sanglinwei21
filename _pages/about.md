## Bridge the gap between learning and optimization for energy system

## Introduction 
I'm pursing my Ph.d degree in Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, Shenzhen, China,  majoring in electrical engineering. I'm trying to aim higher and to be a problem solver in energy system by CS and optimization techniques. I have been supporting Bayern Munich FC since 2011.

## Researches

- Image-based skills (from OpenCV to CNN-based)
- Multi-armed bandits problem for demand response
- Distributed optimization and control
- Online optimization and learning works
- Renewables / electricity prices predictions
- Learning-based optimization
- Optimization-based learning
- Low carbon economics

### Focused topics

- Power system
- Demand response
- Integrated energy system
- Prediction methods 

### Focused methods

- Convex relaxation
- Deep learning
- Mixed integer optimization (MIO) acceleration

## Recent News
- Focus on paper writing 
- Attend hydro discussion in Qinghai University 2021/9/24-2021/9/26
