Machine learning for energy system
======

1. Solving the intractable problem in limited time to get efficient solutions.
------

1.1 Take some heuristics for a feasible solution.

2. Accelerating the solving of conventional problems
------

2.1 Mixed integer linear programming acceleration 

2.2 Motivation: Plenty of renewables and distributed energies are penetrated in the power system.
