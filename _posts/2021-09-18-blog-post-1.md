Machine learning for energy system
======

Solving the intractable problem in limited time to get efficient solutions.
------

1. Take some heuristics for a feasible solution.

Accelerating the solving of conventional problems
------

1. Mixed integer linear programming acceleration 

2. Motivation: Plenty of renewables and distributed energies are penetrated in the power system.
